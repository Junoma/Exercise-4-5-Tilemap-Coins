# Moose on the Loose
The character's name is moose, a player character of my friend's from my DnD campaign, the enemy is a secret evil villian. The background is astronomical because by the time the player meets the enemy, they will be in the astral plane.


## Implementation

Built using Godot 4.1.1

The player sprite is completely made my Penelope Watson (Me) As well as the enemy sprite.
The Music was composed my me, there were three unused tracks also in the files. 
The astronomy backgrounds were all made by me as well, colored in photoshop the blank astronomical files of the hubble space telescope. 

The [tilemap](https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer) and the [coin sprite](https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2](https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack-2) are provided by Kenney.nl.

## What makes this a game?
It is difficult, fun and interesting to look at. 


## Future Development
If I work up the courage, I'll try to add more to this game. I struggle a lot with the tilemaps and that is why I made the choice to have all of the levels as one giant level. I implemented multiple enemies, because if you kill one, she reappears later on in the map. That way you shouldn't see the same one more than once or twice at a time. Dying to her resets you, but at least the obsticle has been absolved!! So it makes perservering worth it.
